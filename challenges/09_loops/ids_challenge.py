# You run a startup media company called Ripple Media
# It's typical when you hire a new employee in your company, to setup a company id for them

print('Question 1')
employee_name = 'Michael Jordan'

# You have decided the format of the id should be: Michael Jordan -> michaeljordan
# Let's write some code that converts a name into a company id that matches this format
# 1.1 TODO: Let's save the lowercase version of the employee_name in a new variable 'lower_name'
# 1.2 TODO: We want to separate the first name and last name and save it in a variable 'names_list'
# 1.3 TODO: We want to join the first name and last name and save it in a variable called 'company_id'

print()

print('Question 2')

# Congratulations! Your team is expanding. Below is a list of their names:
names = ['Max Bartlett', 'Angelita Norris', 'Stewart Mueller', 'Dominique Henry', 'Carmela Gross', 'Bettie Mcmillan', 'Sara Ellison', 'Ira Anthony', 'Pauline Riley', 'Ben Weber',
         'Joanne Mcknight', 'Loren Gould', 'Jamar Singh', 'Amanda Vance', 'Tyrell Andrade', 'Jana Clements', 'Eddy Mcbride', 'Marsha Meyer', 'Elbert Shannon', 'Alyce Hull']

ids = []

# We want to convert all their names into the same format from Question 1
# 2.1 TODO: Use a "for" loop to go over each name in the names list
# 2.2 TODO: Inside the "for" loop, create the company id by re-using the logic from Question 1 and...
# 2.3 TODO: ..add the id to the ids list

print('Question 3')
# You want to figure out the order of these employee ids in your database (in this case, the list of ids).
# Using an f string, print out the index of each element in the 'ids' list and the element itself.
# Print this out in the format "0: michaeljordan".
