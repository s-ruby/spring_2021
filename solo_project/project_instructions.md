# App Project 1!

The goal of this project is to make an app, either a *tip calculator* or *your own survey* in python and put together a new Github repo for it. You can choose either app type

The requirements for your finished project are:

1. You should set up a public Github repo that contains your code, and a `README.md` file. This repo with your app will be part of your code portfolio from this class, so keep it neat, and make the README file look nice using [markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Be sure to give it a title, and provide a brief summary of what your code does, and how to run it. **To submit your project, you will simply submit the link to your Github repo on Canvas**
2. Your app must run propely in python from the command line, and should not require any software or external libraries. (python3 is best -- if you are using python2, please contact your TA to work something out)
3. Whether you choose the tip calculator or the survey, your app must *be interactive and take user input* (see the guidelines for each option) at the command line. This means that your python code must respond appropriately based on what the user enters. 
4. Your code must be well-commented. Demonstrate how much you understand!
5. This project is an *individual* one! You can talk to your classmates for ideas, but all code should be your own.

*Feeling stuck?*
*   You can always reference the [course Github repo](https://github.com/Justice-Through-Code/spring_2021) and use any lessons or challenges there to guide you
* Googling when you are stuck is encouraged! If you find a snippet of code on the internet you want to use, just make sure that you put a link in acknowledging the source, and *comment* it to make sure you understand it. 
* Check in with others in the class, your TAs, and your instructors! Remember that the more proactive you are about seeking out resources, the easier it will be to get on track.


## Option 1: Tip Calculator

Make a python script `tip_calculator.py` that takes a user's input at the command line for:
* Cost of the food
* Number of people splitting the bill
* Percentage of the tip

Then, the script should output:
* The total bill (including tip)
* how much each person should pay

Assume there is a 10% sales tax. Don't forget to add this into the total bill! 


## Option 2: Build your own survey

Make a python script `survey.py` that does the following:

Select a few items from a list
